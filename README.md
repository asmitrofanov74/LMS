# Library Management System with GUI 
Library Management System

Library Management System Application (LMS)
cooperative work of Aleksandr Mitrofanov & Oleksii Chemech

Purpose:
System is mainly to provide automation to the library. 

Scope:
The application is wide and can be used on any PC with Windows OS and also can be use in office with the necessary modifications done.

Technologies Used:
C++, Qt 15.5.0 and Qt Creator for Application GUI and logic. SQLite database for storing information. 

Complexity of the project:
To develop such project will require to combine the GUI ability of Qt with C++ power of memory management as a low-level programming language, which will require a delicate approach to avoid any memory leak. 
With this application, the manual application is converted into an automated application. For assignment purpose customized data is being used. The user will not have the access to enter the data about the books.

Solutions provided by the system are:
•	Independence from any C++ IDE. This application can work on PC with Windows OS without opening in C++ IDE (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks etc.). Any User can launch this application just by clicking on .exe file. Programme tested on Windows 10 x64.
•	User friendly interface. Using GUI, we can provide comfy UI/UX. Users can perform actions just by clicking on icons.
•	Universal data storage, using SQLite. This SQL database engine can provide cross-platform access to the database.  

Open and build this project in Qt. Add database.sql and rules.txt files from database folder to builded project folder. Now you can run it under Qt or deploy it with static build.
